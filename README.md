# Clustering
Applications of clustering techniques:

- To categorize students into groups with similar interests (to facilitate the organization of after-school activities based on these groups, such that the students assigned to each group are as similar as possible, and the activities could be more personalized).

- To categorize ceramic samples based on their chemical composition
